# Naimuri Coding Challenge
My submission for the Naimuri coding challenge

The main goal of the challenge was to connect to the GitHub API to retrieve repositories based on filters that the user has selected, these being:-
- Main language used in the repositories
- Username
- Name of repositry

Once the repositories have been retrieved, the application then outputs the key details of the repositories, these being:-
- Repository name
- Repository author
- Number of forks
- Number of stars
- Number of issues
- README of the repository

Possible improvements:

With this challenge, I took a purely functional approach in my solution, but in hindsight, I think a much better solution would have been obtained if I took an object-oriented approach as I believe the code would be more manageable and scalable in comparison. Using a object-oriented approach would have allowed me to better seperate functions/classes in seperate files, as another issue with my code is the fact that all of my functions are all located in the script.ts file, resulting in a file that is large and is more difficult to read.
